###  *Flat File Systems vs Relational Databases*
| Storage Type             | Structure                     | Data Redundancy |  Relationships | Drawbacks |
| -------------------------| --------------------------                | ----------------          | --------------                | ----------|
| 1. Flat File Systems     | file that contains a single table of data |  High Data Redundancy     |  no relationship              | Harder to Change Data Format, Poor at Complex Queries, requiring all records to have the same fields, less data consistency,one user can access data at a time.     |          
| 2. Relational Databases  | database with one or more tables          |  Low Data Redundancy      | relationship between tables   | more complex with varying costs      |
